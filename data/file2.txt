Computer Science is the study of computers and computational systems. It covers both software and hardware aspects. 
Key areas of computer science include programming, algorithms, data structures, databases, and networking. 
Programming languages such as Python, C++, and Java are widely used. 
Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) are subfields of computer science that focus on making computers learn from data.
